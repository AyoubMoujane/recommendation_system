RecommenderSystem class: This class stores the generated users and contains methods related to recommendation systems

	public void generateData(int nbUsers, int nbItems, float sparsity) 

		Generates random data of users rating movies they watched

	public double computeSimilarity(ArrayList<Float> vector1, ArrayList<Float> vector2)
		
		Returns the similarity between two users using the cosine similarity method

	private void printSimilarityMatrix()

		Prints the similarity matrix of users

	public ArrayList<Integer> getMissingIndexes(ArrayList<Float> vector1)

		returns which movies haven't been rated by a user

	public ArrayList<Float> returnPredictedUser(int index)
		
		returns he user with predicted ratings on movies he hasn't watched
		using the collaborative filtering method.
		We compute the similarity between users and do a weighted average
		with the similarity on missing ratings with other users's ratings.

	public List<Entry> getTopRecommendation(int index, int limit)
	
		returns a ranking of movies that the user is likely to enjoy
		and how much he should enjoy them

Entry class: This method stores a movie id and a rating, we used this method to be able to sort our collection in the topN method in RecommenderSystem class, that's why it implements Comparable.
